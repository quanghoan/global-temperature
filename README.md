# STATISTICS FOR SPATIO - TEMPORAL DATA
## Proposal for Final Project

### Professor: Carlo Gaetan
### Student: Dao Quang Hoan

I. Motivation for the problem

It is widely known that the global average temperature has increased, especially in
recent decades. ​ So it seemed like a good time to analyze a time series of global
temperature of land and ocean to identify and estimate persistent features in climate
change.

II. A description of data

The data set is downloaded from the NASA Official Climate Change website ​ Link
here . The data set combines average temperature of land and ocean. ​ Temperature
densities from globally distributed data during the 1880 to 2017 period are treated as
a time series of functional observations that change over time.

III. Statistical methods: Temporal analysis

- Apply filtering to identify trend.
- Describe the changes.
- Verify the stationarity and the randomness of the time series.
- Evaluate the data support for different of ARIMA processes.
- Make predictions in some periods.
